**INTRODUCTION**

![input.pdf-1-1.png](input.pdf-1-1.png)

The Thermal Insulation Association of Southern Africa (TIASA), currently under the aegis of AAAMSA,
promotes that part of the industry that specializes in the insulation of ceilings, walls, floors, piping and vessels
with cold and hot insulation.

Membership constitutes manufacturers and suppliers of insulation materials, consultants for thermal insulation
as well as contractors who sell and install insulation materials.

This specification refers to the measuring of completed insulation installations for industrial applications and
will enable Architects, Engineers, Quantity Surveyors, Developers and other Specifiers to quantify their
insulation requirements.

Having the installation done by contractors who are members of TIASA will ensure that the installation meets
with the specified performance standards.

This handbook only addresses hot and cold insulation. TIASA is presently preparing information regarding
ambient (building) insulation and the acoustical properties of insulation materials for inclusion in future editions
of this handbook.

Readers are encouraged to submit their comments to the TIASA, which will be considered for inclusion in
future editions.

**INTRODUCING TIASA**

South Africa ratified the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change in August 1997 and is
obliged to develop and submit a National Communication that contains an inventory of greenhouse gas
emissions for a base year (1990) and a strategy to address climate change.

Globally at the centre of this activity are the window, glass and insulation industries and we take this
opportunity to advise our readers that AAAMSA has been appointed to administer “TIASA – The Thermal
Insulation Association of Southern Africa”.

Energy consumption in South Africa measured against output (GDP) is very high compared to its global
competitors and conversely the use of insulation is very low. This is due to the misconception that insulation in
the region is not essential and regarded as a luxury item and also because of the relatively inexpensive cost of
electricity. Cheap fuel has not been used to Southern Africa’s advantage in the production of lower cost goods,
to the contrary it has been abused and used excessively diminishing the long-term resources and contributing to
environmental pollution. Apart from these issues, peak demand for electricity during the winter months far
exceeds the capacity which Eskom can cost effectively supply and the vast majority of affordable homes
currently being built are not energy efficient, further escalating the problem of energy abuse into the future.

**_THESE ISSUES LED TO THE FORMATION OF TIASA_**

The initiative of the Residential Demand Side Management (RDSM) Department of Eskom and a broad
spectrum of concerned parties from government, NGOs and industry resulted in the establishment of TIASA.

TIASA embraces the entire thermal insulation marketplace, including manufacturers, distributors, contractors,
specifiers, consultants, designers, architects, energy service companies, government, utilities and end users.

The mission of TIASA is to improve the environment, and the social and economic well-being of Southern
Africans through the greater use, and better application of, thermal insulation.

Insulation has proved to be effective and beneficial in the following:

-  Reducing energy costs

-  Safety of personnel working in “hot” applications

-  Home comfort control

-  Temperature control in processing equipment

-  Assisting in the reduction of environmental pollution

-  Increasing the manufacturing competitiveness of companies

-  Reducing the consumption of natural resources

-  Reducing noise pollution

-  Increasing the productivity of workers in factories, commercial buildings etc.

Southern Africa can no longer afford to disregard these benefits and ignore the advantages of a carefully and
clearly defined policy on thermal insulation application.

**TIASA PROMOTES THE BENEFITS OF INSULATION**

Although providing a service to all industries, TIASA will initially focus the development of its products and
services for the building and construction industry with specific attention being paid to sustainable energy
efficient affordable homes by:

-  Promoting greater understanding and co-operation among all segments of the insulation industry.

-  Capacity building through education and training on the correct selection and installation of energy-saving
thermal insulation.

-  Developing a database of all products, suppliers, contractors, and interested parties in thermal insulation
and appropriate dissemination of information.

-  Participating in technical, legislative and regulative committees on insulation.

-  Developing international relationships.

-  Enlisting the resources and support of government agencies, utilities, academic and professional societies.

**1.** **INTRODUCTION TO INSULATION**
Energy Conservation is “buzz” words of our times. There are many forms of energy conservation and
this handbook is only concerned with the methods of conserving energy by means of thermal
insulation.

To change the temperature of an object, energy is required in the form of heat generation to increase
temperature, or heat extraction to reduce temperature. Once the heat generation or heat extraction is
terminated a reverse flow of heat occurs to revert the temperature back to ambient. To maintain a given
temperature considerable continuous energy is required. Insulation will reduce this energy loss.

Heat may be transferred in three mechanisms: conduction, convection and radiation. Thermal
conduction is the molecular transport of heat under the effect of a temperature gradient. Convection
mechanism of heat occurs in liquids and gases, whereby flow processes transfer heat. Free convection
is flow caused by differences in density as a result of temperature differences. Forced convection is
flow caused by external influences (wind, ventilators, etc.). Thermal radiation mechanism occurs when
thermal energy is emitted similar to light radiation.

Heat transfers through insulation material occur by means of conduction, while heat loss to or heat gain
from atmosphere occurs by means of convection and radiation.

Heat passes through solid materials by means of conduction and the rate at which this occurs depends
on the thermal conductivity (expressed in W/mK) of the material in question and the temperature drive.
In general the greater the density of a material, the greater the thermal conductivity, for example,
metals has a high density and a high thermal conductivity.

Materials, which have a low thermal conductivity, are those, which have a high proportion of small
voids containing air or gas. These voids are not big enough to transmit heat by convection or radiation,
and therefore reduce the flow of heat.

Thermal insulation materials fall into the latter category. Thermal insulation materials may be natural
substances or man-made.

If the density of insulation is low, the air or gas voids are comparatively large and this makes for the
best insulation for low to medium temperatures where compression and/or vibration is not a factor.

However, where higher temperatures are encountered, the air or gas voids need to be reduced in size to
minimize the convection within the voids and this is achieved by increasing the density of the
insulation. Density may be increased to a point where the solids content of the insulation is such that
the heat bridge of the solids overcomes the insulating effect of the voids. It follows therefore, that by
encasing a container of heat with thermal insulation material the reverse heat flow will be retarded with
resultant reducing energy loss and cost.

The word “retarded” is important because no matter how much insulation is applied, the reverse flow of
heat to ambient can never be stopped. The primary reasons for insulation are many and varied, the
main ones being:

-  To conserve energy

-  To reduce heat loss or gain

-  To maintain a temperature condition

-  To maintain the effective operation of equipment or chemical reaction

-  To assist in maintaining a product at a constant temperature

-  To prevent condensation

-  To create a comfortable environmental condition

-  To protect personnel

The type and thickness of insulation depend on the foregoing primary reasons together with the
parameters of the specific conditions.

Economic thickness is the thickness of insulation, which will result in minimum total cost of energy
losses plus the cost of the erected insulation. The calculation of economic thickness is complex and in
some cases is overruled by the other listed primary reasons, which can make the calculation
unnecessary.

The exception is when retro fitting of insulation is envisaged. Retro fitting is the application of
additional insulation to existing insulation to further reduce heat loss or gain in order to reduce the cost
of energy losses.

The economic thickness calculation has to be prepared by the user and is not usually the function of the
insulation contractor. It includes salient factors such as:

-  Cost of the energy losses, which include capital cost of installed equipment to generate/extract
heat

-  Expected price movement in the cost of fuel

-  Capital cost of installed insulation

-  Payback period that the user requires for capital investments

-  Various other accounting factors


-----


**CHAPTER 2:** **OVERVIEW OF INSULATION SYSTEMS**
In order to describe all the complexities of thermal insulation a large volume would be required.
Consequently, this handbook has been produced as a reference for common practice in South Africa. If
more detail is required, it is suggested that BS 5970 “Code of practice for thermal insulation of pipe
work and equipment in the temperature range - 100°C to 870°C” be consulted.

If there is a temperature differential between the process and ambient conditions, heat will flow from
the higher to the lower temperature.

Throughout the handbook the following shall apply:

-  Where the insulation is used to prevent heat loss from the process the term hot insulation will be
used.

-  Where the insulation is used to prevent heat gain to the process the term cold insulation will be
used.

-  Where the insulation is used to prevent heat loss and heat gain in buildings the term Ambient
Insulation will be used. The Ambient Insulation section is currently under preparation and will be
published at a later date.

In addition to the basic insulation material, a system may need:

-  Supports for the insulation

-  Fastenings for the insulation

-  A vapour seal in case of cold insulation

-  Mechanical or weather protection of the insulation, for example, metal cladding

-  Supports for the protection

-  Fastenings for the protection

-  Finishing, for example, paint coatings, decorative finishes or identification bands

-  Heat tracing with or without heat transfer cement

In this handbook unit designations are (according to the SI system):

-  Density kg/m 3

-  Thickness mm

-  Temperature °C

-  Differential temperature K

-  Thermal conductivity W/mK

**2.1     PRE-INSULATION APPLICATION**
2.1.1 Before insulation is applied; all surfaces to be insulated shall be thoroughly cleaned
to remove dirt, oil, moisture, loose rust or any other foreign matter.

2.1.2 **PRESSURE AND LEAK TESTING**
It is recommended that pressure and leak testing be carried out and any repairs
effected prior to application of insulation. In many cases this is a statutory
requirement.

2.1.3 **HEAT TRANSFER CEMENT AND HEAT TRACING**
If a temperature is to be maintained by means of external heat sources such as heat
tracers, heat transfer cement may have to be applied to improve the heat transfer from
the tracer in severe cases. The manufacturer’s recommendations should be consulted.

2.1.4 **CORROSION PROTECTION**
Where the operating temperature is less than 130°C and the equipment or pipe work
is other than austenitic alloy, the surfaces should be coated with a suitable paint. It
has been found that below this temperature corrosion conditions can occur.

Most thermal insulations will not, of themselves, cause stress corrosion cracking as
may be shown by tests. When exposed to elevated temperature (boiling point range
80°C and 200°C), environments containing chlorides, moisture and oxygen, however,
insulation systems may act as collecting media, transmigrating and concentrating
chlorides on heating stainless steel surfaces. If moisture is not present, the chloride
salt cannot migrate, and stress corrosion cracking because of chloride contaminated
insulation cannot take place – ASTM C692-97.


-----


Page 3

![input.pdf-7-0.png](input.pdf-7-0.png)

If insulation is to be applied over certain austenitic alloy steel where the operating
temperature is between 80°C and 200°C, it is recommended to apply a stress
corrosion barrier before the application of the insulation so as to prevent stress
corrosion. At 500°C and above none of the stress corrosion barrier materials can
withstand the temperatures and therefore should not be used.

It should be noted that during startup and shutdown, operating temperatures might
occur within this temperature band and under such circumstances stress corrosion
could occur.

The barrier may be aluminium foil not less than 0,06mm thick or a specially
formulated paint may be applied.  The recommendations of the manufacturer should
be followed particularly in respect of limiting temperature of the dried film.

2.1.5 **PRE-INSTALLATION SUPPORTS**

Insulation supports shall be installed prior to the application of the insulation.

**2.2** **DESIGNING INSULATION SYSTEMS**
Factors, which influence the design of an insulation system, are:
2.2.1 **LOCATION OF PLANT**

-  Indoors

-  Outdoors protected from the weather

-  Outdoors exposed to the weather

-  Shape, size and elevations all need to be taken into consideration

2.2.2 **TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS**

-  The normal operating temperatures

-  The extreme temperature if other than normal operating temperature

-  Any fluctuating temperature

-  Duration of extreme or fluctuating temperatures

2.2.3 **SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS**

-  Ambient temperature

-  Relative humidity to establish dew point for cold insulation

-  Flammable conditions

-  Potentially corrosive atmosphere

-  Acidic conditions in atmosphere

-  Air flow over insulated surface (wind velocity)

2.2.4 **SPECIAL OR SERVICE CONDITIONS REQUIREMENTS**

-  Resistance to compression, for example, foot traffic

-  Resistance to fire

-  Resistance to vibration

-  Resistance to mechanical damage

-  Resistance to corrosive fluids or gases

-  Anticipated wide fluctuations of temperature, for example, steam out

-  Resistance of insulation protection to ingress of oils and flammable liquids

-  Application of insulation over special alloys

-  Resistance to moisture and other weather conditions

-  Resistance to Vermin

**2.3** **DESIGN CALCULATIONS**

The design of an insulation system is governed by the insulated operating values, which the
plant requires after insulation.

The values may be:

-  Emissive

-  Thermal conditions – Heat loss/Heat gain

-  Process temperature drop or rise

-  Condensation prevention

-  Personnel protection temperature

-  Optimal economic conditions (See page 1)

-  Thermal conductivity of insulation material

-  Ambient temperature

-  Wind velocity

Calculations are by the formulae as set in Section 5.2, which are to British Standard BS 5422.
Other international standards may be used. The calculated values are theoretical and should
be adjusted for practical, design and atmospheric considerations.

**2.4     SUPPORT SYSTEMS**
Support systems may be required for insulation, cladding or composite for both. The cost of
fabrication and attachment of supports to the equipment forms a significant part of the
insulation cost and therefore the method of attachment must be well defined prior to the issue
of any insulation inquiry.

It is recommended that where post-manufacture welding is not permitted, the equipment
manufacturer undertake the fitting of supports.

2.4.1 **CYLINDRICAL VESSELS**

Where post-welding is not permitted and the manufacturer has not included supports
the contractor must fit support rings using a non-welding method.

The criteria for this method are:

-  Suitable pitch

-  The total weight of the system to be supported

-  Thermal expansion or contraction of the equipment

2.4.2 **FLAT SURFACES**

Support systems on flat surfaces should take into account:

-  The disposition of the surface, i.e., underside, vertical, horizontal or inclined

-  The total system mass to be supported

-  Thermal expansion or contraction of the equipment.

2.4.3 **HEAT BRIDGES**

Where metal cladding comes in contact with support steel, hot spots for hot
insulation and condensation for cold insulation will occur. It is therefore
recommended to insulate between the contact points.

**2.5    MAIN INSULATION TYPES**

-  Boards or batts - A rigid binder bound fibrous insulation for use on flat or large
cylindrical surfaces

-  Felt - A semi-flexible binder bound fibrous insulation for use on all surfaces where
vibration is of a low order for example Boilers

-  Loose - Loose or granulated insulation with a low binder content for filling voids


-----


Page 5

![input.pdf-9-0.png](input.pdf-9-0.png)

-  Mattress - A flexible low binder fibrous insulation for use on all surfaces. A wire
mesh fixed to one or both sides by through stitching maintains the mattress shape.
Because of the low binder content the material is able to withstand higher
temperature without binder breakdown.

-  Pipe section - Insulation preformed to fit in two halves round cylindrical surfaces of
various diameters.

-  Pipe section covered - As for pipe section except that the outer surface is fitted with a
cover by the manufacturer, for example, canvas or foil

-  Segments - Cylindrical insulation for fitting round large cylindrical surfaces in more
than two parts. Confined to the closed cell insulants.

-  Slab - All the closed cell flat insulation and expanded/extruded insulants fall into this
category and may be applied to all surfaces provided they are suitably shaped.

-  Rope - Usually of fibrous material for spirally wrapping around small pipes.

-  Spray fibre - Used for insulating irregular shapes such as turbines and also for
fireproofing.

-  Spray foam - Usually polyurethane or polyisocyanurate. The main applications are
for large regular surfaces such as roofs or tanks and for cavity filling.

-  Tape - Usually of fibre and used for spiral wrapping on pipe work where conditions
so demand.

**2.6** **GENERAL NOTES ON INSULATION TYPES**

The use of felt or mattress is not recommended over cylindrical shapes of less than 200mm
outside diameter.

Under certain circumstances boards or slab may be used on cylindrical surfaces by cutting the
insulation into bevelled staves.

The general practice on certain applications when installing where the total insulation
thickness exceeds 50mm, a multi-layer system should be used with staggered joints to reduce
heat loss or gain through direct paths to atmosphere.

When very high or very low temperatures are encountered expansion or contraction joints
should be provided. These are usually 40mm wide and packed with a suitable insulant.

It is incumbent on the manufacturers to provide all the necessary values such as thermal
conductivity (k factor) and water vapour permeance based on the tests conducted by a testing
authority. If required, the test number and date should be given together with the particular
test method and conditions.
Important: Because of the health hazards involved, products containing asbestos should
not be used. Where asbestos has to be used, adherence to the OSH act and
regulations should be followed.
Local insulation is normally preferred due to cost, delivery and wastage
factors.

**2.7** **VAPOUR BARRIERS**
All insulation designated as “cold” must be provided with a vapour barrier and this procedure
is set out in Chapter 4 - Cold insulation.

**2.8** **PROTECTION OF INSULATION**
The insulation required to be protected from mechanical damage and the elements (weather
barrier). Protection of the insulation may consist of metal cladding or a coating system.

2.8.1 **METAL CLADDING**
The main metals used are:

-  Galvanised steel

-  Pre-painted or pre-coated steel

-  Aluminium

-  Stainless steel

-  Other specialised formulations


-----


Page 6

![input.pdf-10-0.png](input.pdf-10-0.png)

Depending upon the requirements of the application the metal may be flat sheet or
profiled.

The thickness depends on the degree of mechanical damage, which the cladding is
expected to withstand and may vary from 0,5mm to 1,2mm. For areas susceptible to
heavy damage a thicker gauge may be required.

In the application of cladding it should be ensured that:

-  Good water shedding exists at all joints or sealing of joints where this is not
possible.

-  At point where dissimilar metals may come in contact with one another
precautions must be taken to prevent galvanic action.

-  All metal joints must be straight and square to preserve a symmetrical
appearance.

-  The cladding system must be constructed so that due allowance is provided for
the expansion or contraction of the equipment.

-  Where the cladding is applied over a vapour barrier, great care must be taken to
avoid puncturing the vapour barrier either during or after erection, for example,
a spacer or protective liner.

2.8.2 **PLASTER FINISHES**

The term plaster includes both hard-setting plaster and mastics, which may be used
separately or together.

Plaster may be used on all surfaces but when exposed to the weather it should be over
coated with a mastic or finishing paint.

If plaster is to be used over a fibrous insulation the insulation must be of sufficient
density to withstand the trowel application.

Mastic is not suitable for direct application to fibrous insulation. Generally, the
purpose of the plaster is to provide a surface resistant to mechanical damage and/or a
foundation for the mastic, which provides the waterproofing.

Both the plaster and the mastic should be applied in two layers with a reinforcing
between the layers, i.e., galvanised wire mesh for the plaster and fibreglass mesh for
the mastic. The first coat in each case should provide an anchor to ensure a key for
the second.

Because of its high mass, the plaster coat is subject to slipping on large vertical
surfaces. The wire mesh reinforcing must therefore be tied back, with binding wire, to
fixed supports on the equipment.

**3.** **HOT INSULATION**

**3.1** **GENERAL NOTES**

Equipment or pipe work with an operation temperature greater than 55°C in case of
metallic surfaces and 65°C in the case of non-metallic surfaces should be insulated so that
the surface temperature after insulation (cold surface temperature) does not exceed 55°C.

It is recognised that temperatures of 60°C or greater will result in extreme discomfort to
personnel and therefore a maximum cold surface temperature of 55°C should be
considered as prudent.

If the fluid inside the pipe or vessel is likely to remain static for long periods when the
ambient temperature is below the freezing point of the fluid, it is important that this shall
be stated. Also, the fluid in small diameter pipes may be especially susceptible to
freezing, particularly if the rate of flow is intermittent or slow, it may be necessary to
consider the use of supplementary means of heating, possibly only in local areas, like heat
tracing.

**3.2** **SELECTION OF HOT INSULATION MATERIALS**

The objective is to select a material, which will serve the insulation purpose at the lowest
cost. This can be a complicated procedure.

In addition to the factors listed in section 2.2 careful considerations should be given to
insulation thickness. On pipe work an over-specification of thickness creates a needless
increase in the cost of the outer protection.

When a multi-layer system of insulation is envisaged, the selection of materials is
interdependent on the type of protection and the calculations as set out in Annex 2
paragraph 5.2. For example, an aluminium protection will result in a higher cold surface
temperature and a lower heat. (Aluminium protection has a low emissivity and therefore
radiates less heat).

Where constant load supports are involved, the mass of the insulation system becomes
critical and must be kept within the tolerances of such constant load supports. Where
used for internal linings of ventilation ductwork the thermal insulating material itself
should be non-combustible as defined in BS 476: Part 4

**3.3** **HOT INSULATION MATERIALS**

Common to all these materials, it is recommended that their use be limited to conditions
of 90% of the manufacturer’s limiting temperatures in order to safeguard against
temperature surge at start-up operations of plant.

Please note: Information provided in the following tables is generic information
suitable for feasibility studies and cost estimates.

Actual figures may differ from manufacturer to manufacturer and must
be confirmed with the individual manufacturer.

**3.5** **APPLICATION OF HOT INSULATION**

Pipe section, mattress or any flexible insulation may be used for pipe work. However,
practical reasons preclude the use of mattress or flexible insulation where the outside diameter
of the pipe or the outside diameter of any previous layer of insulation is 200mm or less.

Where mattress or materials of low density are used and metal is the protection medium,
supports should be provided for the metal at not more than 1-metre intervals where the pipe
work is horizontal or inclined up to 45°. Between 45° and the vertical the spacing of the
supports is dependent on temperature and expansion requirements. (Refer BS 5970).

As a guide, the expansion allowances on pipe work are generally 1mm per running meter per
100°C of temperature. In all applications of insulation the material must be well butted
together and in the case of multi-layer applications all joints of each subsequent layer must be
staggered from the previous layer. Weld pins or clips, binding wire and strapping are used for
securing the insulation as a single or composite system dependent on the circumstances.

**4.** **COLD INSULATION**

**4.1** **GENERAL NOTES**

Cold insulation should be considered and where operating temperatures are below ambient
where protection is required against heat gain, condensation or freezing.

In designing an insulation system where formulae and surface coefficients are used they
should be to an appropriate international standard, for example, BS 5422 is recommended. In
selection of material density, it should be considered whether insulation requires being load
bearing or not.

For whatever purpose cold insulation is required, the insulation system is only as good as its
vapour barrier and the care with which it is installed. A vapour barrier is a membrane of very
low permeance placed on the warm side of insulation to limit the flow of water vapour into the
insulation. Table **7** of BS 5970 shows the water vapour permeance of various insulation
materials.

Where there is a differential in temperature or humidity between the cold surface of the
equipment and the ambient temperature a differential water vapour pressure occurs. The
greater the temperature differential, the greater the differential water vapour pressure. Water
vapour should not be confused with moisture. Water vapour is a transparent, tasteless and
odourless gas capable of permeating through most materials depending on the pressure
differential on either side of the insulation.

Permeability of water through a vapour barrier is expressed in Metric Perms in the metric
system. A Metric Perm is the passage of 1 gram of water through a material with a surface
area of 1m 2 for 24 hours and a pressure difference of 1mm Hg.

Many materials, which are moisture-resistant, are not necessarily vapour-resistant. All
insulation materials are susceptible to water vapour penetration to various degrees. If
penetration is not prevented, the water vapour condenses to moisture or ice when its
temperature reaches the dew point. This will, in time, saturate the insulation thereby rendering
it useless. To prevent this from taking place, a vapour barrier is applied on the warm side of
the insulation.

Even a pinhole through the vapour barrier can eventually render the insulation system useless;
therefore the selection of a vapour barrier needs careful consideration. Foil or sheet usually
have the better permeability rating but foil has poor resistance to mechanical damage and
needs a protective cover or protective laminate. Sheet metal has a good rating but requires
great care in the sealing of joints and fastenings.

Water, solvent and mastic based vapour barriers tend to be resistant to mechanical damage.
Their permeability rating varies from water based at the bottom of the scale to cured resins at
the top. Most of these types, however **,** need to be suitably reinforced.

When using water-based formulations, they dry out, and in doing so leave minute pinholes. It
is therefore essential that the manufacturer’s recommended thickness be considered as a
minimum to prevent pinholes extending continuously through the coating and, as a further
precaution, the application must consist of multiple coats.

In the case of solvent based vapour barriers the manufacturer’s application procedures must be
carefully followed, as the danger of solvent entrapment exists due to premature over coating
resulting in surface “bubbles”.

Resin-cured vapour barriers are excellent but again the manufacturer’s recommended
thickness should be considered minimum. Adherence to the manufacturer’s mixing
proportions is mandatory. The application must be multiple coats. Vapour barrier
applications are only as good as the applicator. Where the insulation terminates, the vapour
barrier must be returned to the cold equipment so as to totally encapsulate the insulation.

In selecting a vapour barrier, material comparisons should be made between the various
permeability ratings as supplied by manufacturers as there may be vast differences between
materials as reference to Table 7 of BS 5970 shows.


-----


![input.pdf-21-0.png](input.pdf-21-0.png)

Page 17

Care should be taken to ensure that the choice of vapour barriers does not affect the fire
performance of the whole assembly of insulating and finishing materials (see 4.2).

The design of the cold insulation system should assume that at some time a breakdown of the
vapour barrier might occur.

In such an event, and in the case of cold rooms, it is better that the water vapour has an
unhindered path to the cold surface to enable it to be drawn off by the refrigeration equipment.
In the case of pipe work and vessels, it is preferable that the water vapour has free passage to
the cold surface where the resultant water or ice will be encased by the insulation.

A break in the vapour barrier of the insulation system will eventually cause the system to fail
but its effective life will have been prolonged by a design which permits the through
transmission of water vapour.

Adhesives or mastics for the application of insulation should be used with care as vapour dams
may be created which would negate the principle of the previous paragraph.

If one has limited experience, it is recommended that a member of TIASA be consulted before
embarking on cold insulation. Whatever the primary reason for cold insulation, it should be
designed to prevent condensation.

Condensation occurs when water vapour in the atmosphere comes in contact with a surface at
a temperature of less or equal to the dew point. Therefore, if the surface temperature is less
than the dew point, condensation will occur.

The presence of condensation on the warm side of the vapour barrier has no detrimental effect
on the insulation but, nevertheless, it is a condition, which has to be avoided. To prevent
condensation, the insulation thickness should be so designed that temperature on the warm
side of the vapour barrier is above the dew point.

In calculating the thickness of insulation required to prevent condensation, it is prudent to
know or assume conditions of high relative humidity. If the fluid inside the pipe or vessel is
likely to remain static for long periods when the ambient temperature is below the freezing
point of the fluid, it is important that this shall be stated. Also, the fluid in small diameter
pipes may be especially susceptible to freezing, particularly if the rate of flow is intermittent or
slow, it may be necessary to consider the use of supplementary means of heating, possibly
only in local areas, like heat tracing.

**4.2    VACUUM INSULATION PANELS**
**4.2.1** **VACUUM INSULATION**

Vacuum insulation is an advanced thermal insulation technology that significantly
outperforms closed-cell foams, foam beads or fibre blankets. While these traditional
systems attempt to trap gases to reduce the transfer of heat, vacuum insulation
removes the gases within the insulating space. With the space evacuated or placed
‘under vacuum’, the molecular presence and movement needed to transfer heat is
greatly reduced.

**4.2.2** **VACUUM INSULATION PANELS**

Vacuum Insulation panels, or VIP’s, consist of a filler material called a ‘core’ that is
encapsulated by a thin, super-barrier film, such as a metal foil or metallic film
laminate.  The encapsulated system is then evacuated to a vacuum between 0,13 and
1,30 Pa and sealed. The actual vacuum required depends on the specific core
material used and the desired thermal resistance or ‘R-value’ of the finished panel.
The core, when under vacuum, serves to interrupt the ‘mean free path’ of what few
heat transmitting molecules remain in the panel, while also withstanding external
pressures that can be as high as 101,3 kPa due to the forces exerted on the VIP from
atmospheric pressure. Being nearly impervious to outside gases, the barrier film
sustains the required vacuum level (and thus, R-value) for the desired life of the
panel. To trap any molecules entering the panel or the modest ‘out gassing’ that may
occur from the VIP component materials, water and/or gas adsorbing materials are
also placed inside the panel to maintain the vacuum for the intended life of the VIP.

Page 18

**4.2.3** **PRODUCT SUMMARY**

The vacuum insulation ‘core’ is 100 percent open-cell, micro cellular polystyrene
foam used as filler in VIP’s. When vacuum levels are held between 13 and 130 Pa,
the insulating potential for VIP’s is three to seven times greater than conventional
insulating systems. Therefore, where thinner or more reliable insulation is required,
VIP’s can offer significant design flexibility and cost savings. The insulation core is
available as grey board stock in various grades and thickness to meet the
performance needs of the marketplace.

**4.3** **VACUUM INSULATION FOR CRYOGENIC PIPING AND VESSELS**

This is a system that utilizes an outer metal jacket, which is installed around the pipe or vessel
containing the medium in such a way so as to achieve a cavity between the outside of the
pipe/vessel and the jacket.

This cavity is then placed under a negative pressure and a vacuum sustained.

This insulating system is conventionally utilized for maintaining cryogenic products such as
oxygen and nitrogen at temperatures of -196°C and -187°C respectively.

**4.4** **SELECTION COLD INSULATION OF MATERIALS**

Closed-cell insulation is the most commonly specified material used for cold work because it
possesses a degree of resistance to water vapour and because the thermal conductivity (K
factor) of some of these materials is better than the fibrous alternative products.

Selection of insulation materials should be carefully considered where the possibility of steam
purging of the equipment is required or for other reasons which may cause the temperature to
be increased to a level which exceeds the maximum limiting temperature of the insulation
materials, i.e., material then deteriorate.

Special precautions to prevent the possibility of combustion must be exercised when
insulating piping, fittings or equipment containing oxygen, as the insulation system should
then not contain any organics. It is therefore strongly recommended that the material
suppliers are consulted prior selection of the insulation material. The fibrous materials
referred to in section 3.3 may be used for cold insulation where conditions such as fire
resistance so demand. However, because of their poor resistance to water vapour, extra care
must be taken in the selection and application of the vapour barrier.

In case of fire, certain insulation systems may generate appreciable quantities of smoke and
noxious and toxic fumes. Consideration should be given to the choice of materials, bearing in
mind their location, for example, in enclosed areas or adjacent to air ducts through which
smoke or fumes may spread as per the local requirement and specifications.

If there is a potential hazard from contamination by oil or other flammable chemicals, a
suitably resistant finish, for example, metal sheet or appropriate non-absorbent coating, shall
be applied over the vulnerable areas. The lapped joints of sheet finishes shall be arranged to
shed contaminating fluids away from the insulating material.

**4.6** **APPLICATION OF COLD INSULATION**

Generally on pipe work, preformed pipe sections should be used or alternatively an in-situ or
spray application could be considered. All insulation should fit snugly around piping and
equipment. On low temperature insulation work all attachments to the piping or equipment
and projecting through the insulation should also be insulated for a distance of four times the
thickness of the basic insulation from the point where the projection is exposed.

All the insulation and the vapour barrier should be continuous at pipe supports. Where metal
cradles preformed to the outside diameter of the insulation are provided at the pipe supports
the cradle should be designed to prevent undue compression of the insulation due to the
weight of the insulated pipe.

Higher density insulation preformed material often manufactured from PUR, PIC, phenolic
foam or wood can be used between the support and the pipe to accommodate the weight if
considered necessary.

Insulation contraction joints should be provided for Firebreaks should be provided at, for
example, 20m maximum or where the insulated pipe passes from one building to another.
Where total thickness of insulation exceeds 50mm it should be applied to multiple layers and
all joints should be staggered to prevent direct heat paths to the cold face. The creation of
cavities should be avoided.

4.6.1 **JOINT SEALERS AND ADHESIVES**

All materials intended for use for cryogenic insulation of pipes and vessels should
be checked for their suitability at low temperatures and if, for example, no
acceptable joint mastic is available for -196°C (liquid oxygen, nitrogen, etc) then
only the joints on the outer layer on a multi-layer system should be sealed.

Joint sealers and adhesives should be completely compatible with the insulation,
vapour barrier and the item being insulated (refer manufacturer’s
recommendations).

When insulating low temperature pipe work, it is advisable to create
circumferential vapour dams extending from the bare pipe to the vapour seal on the
warm side of the insulation. The longitudinal spacing of the dams is arbitrary and
as a guide, 2m, for very low temperatures to 10m for, say chilled water, should be
considered. The purpose of the dams is to prevent the failure of long sections of
pipe insulation should the warm side vapour seal be ruptured in any way.

4.6.4 **SUPPORTS FOR INSULATION**

The following can support insulation:

-  Adhesive

-  Pins – plastic or nylon

-  Strapping bands for large cylindrical surfaces

-  Pressure-sensitive tape for small diameter surfaces

-  Pre-installed insulation support rings, normally used on large vertical vessels.

4.6.3 **VAPOUR BARRIERS**
The following tables provides a guideline for the required water vapour permeance
for different plant cold surface temperatures:

|Col1|Required water vapour permeance in relation to plant temperature at an|Col3|Col4|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||ambient temperature of +10°C (dry bulb)||||
|Temperature of plant (cold surface)||Water vapour permeance of barrier|||

|-10||0,002|0,023||
|-15||0,0015|0,017||
|-20 to –40||0,001|0,012||

-  Tested in acceptance with ASTM E96 Desiccant method.
** Recommended Dry Film Thickness

Note: It is recommended that the users contact the manufacturer for fore information.

4.6.5 **STRUCTURAL BARRIERS**

Often prefabricated to exact dimensions required and ready to install, these are
rigid sheets of reinforced plastic, galvanized, aluminium or stainless steel jacketing
- flat, corrugated or embossed.

4.6.6 **MEMBRANE BARRIERS**

Metal foils, laminated foils and treated papers, plastic films and sheets, and coated
felts and paper - these are either part of the insulation as supplied or can be
supplied separately.

4.6.7 **COATING BARRIERS**

In fluid form as a paint or mastic (or semi-fluid of the hot-melt variety) the
material can be asphaltic, resinous or polymeric. These provide a seamless coating
but require time to dry and are normally reinforced with a membrane sandwiched
between layers.

Special attention must be given to vapour sealing of protrusions, joints or any other
discontinuities such as glands, local to valve spindles or mechanical drives, etc.
Refer to the following tables

4.6.8 **PROTECTION OF INSULATION**

Protection of the insulation may consist of metal cladding or a coating system.

Metal and non-metallic finishes should generally be as per the insulation guideline
for hot insulation. However, care should be taken where piping and equipment is
being clad; the cladding should be manufactured and installed so as to prevent the
vapour barrier being punctured. Cushioning material applied between screws or
rivets and vapour barrier, or other suitable means, would be a normal practice.

**5.2.2** **THERMAL CALCULATIONS**

**HEAT LOSS FROM INSULATED SURFACES -** May be calculated either from a
knowledge of the thermal conductivity and thickness of each individual insulation
layer or from a knowledge of the “equivalent thermal Conductivity.”

**HEAT GAIN** – When the surface to be insulated is below ambient temperature, heat
will be gained rather than lost. This fact will be indicated in the formulae in this
section by a negative value being show for “Q”.

**AMBIENT CONDITIONS** – Calculations are based on “still air” conditions. It is
possible to consider “exposed” conditions, but this then needs details of wind speed,
size, type and orientation of the surface being insulated.
However, it is the heat loss from bare or non-insulated surfaces that is most affected
by exposed conditions and the increased in heat loss from well-insulated surfaces is
minimal.

**SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF PIPE/VESSELS** – Calculations are based on the
assumption that the surface temperature of the pipe/vessel is the same as that of the
contained fluid. This is not quite true, but the difference is very small.

5.2.3 **SURFACE HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENT**

The surface heat transfer coefficients of the cladding will vary according to the
nature of the surface and the temperature. Each surface material has its own unique
emissivity. For practical purposes these can be grouped into the following three
categories:

-  BRIGHT surfaces are those with low emissivity, e.g. bright metal surfaces,
polished aluminium, etc.

-  PLANISHED surfaces are those with medium emissivity, e.g. galvanized
steel, hammered aluminium, aluminium paint, etc


-----


Annex 2 – Page 2

![input.pdf-39-0.png](input.pdf-39-0.png)

-  NORMAL surfaces are those with high emissivity, e.g. composition,
canvas, plastic sheeting, unfaced insulation, painted metal surfaces, etc.

The surface coefficients are:
Bright    f = 5,7 W/m 2 K ………. Aluminium f = 5,7 W/m 2 K
Planished   f = 8,0 W/m 2 K ……….. Galv. Steel    f = 6,3 W/m 2 K
Normal     f = 10,0 W/m 2 K ………. Mastics      f = 10,0 W/m 2 K

Above approximately 50°C, the surface coefficients will increase slightly with an
increase in temperature. For a given hot face temperature and thickness of insulation,
a Bright finish will give a higher surface temperature and lower heat loss than other
finishes. A Normal finish will give a lower surface temperature but a higher heat
loss.

Thus, when designing for specific surface temperatures, the nature of the surface
finishes can have a considerable effect on the thickness of insulation required.

The effect of air velocity is important. For example, increasing air velocity will
decrease cladding temperature of a hot vessel.

**5.2.3** **CALCULATION PROCEDURES**

Most calculations must start by making an estimate of the outer surface temperature
of the insulation and, for multi-layer insulation, estimates of the interface
temperatures. The surface coefficients can be established. The k-value can be
determined from the relevant nomographs, using the estimated temperatures.

Inserting the hot face and ambient temperatures, the insulation thickness and k-values
and, if appropriate, the pipe diameter into the heat loss formula, will result in a heat
loss.
The surface temperature (and interface temperatures for multi-layer insulation) is
then calculated. If the calculated temperatures agree, or are within 1°C of the
estimated temperatures, the calculations can be considered to be correct.

Agreement is seldom reached on the first calculation, so the calculation must be
repeated, using the calculated temperatures as the new “estimates”, bearing in mind
that the relevant k-values will change according to the change in the hot face and
cold face/interface temperatures.

Repeat the procedure of using the calculated temperatures as the new estimates until
agreement is reached.

**5.2.4** **THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY**

The units of thermal conductivity – k-value – are W/mK, where K represents a
differential temperature of 1 degree Kelvin, which is exactly the same as a
differential temperature of 1 degree Celsius.

**5.2.7** **DETERMINE** **REQUIRED** **INSULATION** **THICKNESS** **FOR**
**CONDENSATION CONTROL**

Condensation will occur if the surface temperature falls below the dew point
temperature – the temperature at which the ambient air of a certain relative humidity
will be become saturated if cooled.

The insulation thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the surface temperature of
the vapour barrier is above the dew point temperature for the worst anticipated
conditions of temperature and humidity.

5.2.7.1 **FLAT SURFACES**

5.2.7.2 **PIPES**

**5.2.8** **SPECIALISED CONDITIONS AT THE POINT OF DELIVERY**

During the flow through a pipe system, a fluid will lose or gain heat, the effects of
which are associated directly with the transmission of heat through the insulation and
also with that in local areas of bare surfaces.

The heat transmission to or from the system remains constant given constant
temperature conditions, but the change in temperature depends on:

-  The rate of mass flow

-  The specific heat capacity of the fluid. Variation in pressure during passage
through the system is an additional consideration if the fluid is a gas or a
vapour.

Logarithmic formula:

Where tA = initial temperature (°C)
tB = final temperature (°C)
tM = ambient temperature (°C)
tX = mean temperature of fluid (°C)
G = mass flow rate (kg/s)
c = specific heat capacity (J/kgK)
L = length off pipe line (m)

**5.3.1** **METHOD A**

Applicable where contractor has quoted unit rate per linear metre of straight pipe and per each
for pipefitting.

**5.3.1.1** **STRAIGHT PIPE**

Shall be measured from origin to terminus point or junction, along the centerline of
pipe. Measurements shall be through valves, flanges and fittings, but only if the
valves, flanges and fittings are insulated. Elbows or bends shall be measured
through to the intersection of the centre lines of the pipe. Reducers shall be
counted as one fitting of the larger size involved, and omitted from the count of the
smaller size. Tees shall be counted as one fitting, and if an unequal tee, shall be
counted as a fitting of the smaller size. Quantities shall be to the nearest whole
number (0.51 and larger to the whole number above).

**5.3.1.2** **FITTINGS - VALVES**

Shall be counted per each. (Flanges on flanged valves shall be counted separately).

**5.3.1.3** **FLANGES**

Shall be counted per pair of flanges. (Including flanges on valves and connections
to vessels and equipment).

**5.3.2** **METHOD B**

Applicable where the contract has quoted unit rate per square metre of completed insulation.
Areas of completed insulation will be measured as defined in attached schedule. Should there
be any items not detailed, the client and the contractor are to agree a system of measurement
in advance.

**Notes:**

-  All external insulation is measured over the outer surface area of the completed
insulation.

-  All internal insulation is measured over the surface area, which has been insulated.

-  The method establishes actual areas of insulation, and makes no extra over allowance
for difficulty of work as regards formwork or height. Should the contractor wish to
charge an increased rate for difficult work he should specify to which items the quoted
increased rate will apply.

-  Quantities shall be calculated to the nearest whole number (0.51 and larger to the
whole number above).

**5.3.3** **GENERAL**

-  Cutouts under 1,0m 2 are not deducted.

-  End cap areas are measured to establish the actual surface area of insulation.

-  Cut outs in such areas are treated as follows:

a) If gross area of end cap is less than 1,0m 2 cutouts are not deducted.
b) If gross area of end cap is 1,0m 2 or greater, deduct cutouts, but subject to
rule (a) above.
c) Pockets, niches, flattening shall be measured as if the cladding remains
symmetrical.
